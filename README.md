# Darwin-Type: a CSS Copy-Cat Challenge

Being bad at CSS, I decided I wanted to push myself to make something as pretty as the page at http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/. I was particularly struck by how good the Darwin paper looked, and wanted to try making something similar myself.

So of course, instead of making something similar, I decided I'd try and copy the damn thing. This repository is my effort to make something that looks very like -- but not identical to -- the Darwin section on Beautiful Web Type.

*(I'm treating it like a rough mockup: I learn CSS by copying a design, without worrying that it's not absolutely pixel-perfect. I'll leave the latter for future projects.)*
